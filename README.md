# HumhubPurpleTheme
Purple theme for Humhub. 


This is the theme I'm using for my Humhub community. Its pretty purple with graident first and second topbar along with gradient pannels going from a darkish purple to a brightish pink. I also included a default banner image. If you want to use the default banner image I provided them move it to static/img folder replacing the default_banner.jpg file. This theme isn't completley finish yet as I will continue to make some improvements here and there. Feel free to edit the theme and chage what you want. If you notice that some of the code doesn't work of that a specific object doesn't show up or is hard to see. Please let me know what page and what the object is that is difficult so I can change it in my theme as well. I am not including any altered views in the this theme. Just the css and images. I plan on changing the default profile image as well. 

The default banner in spaces ends up being huge for some reason. I'll invistigate it at a later time as I can manage this simpley by replacing the banner in the space myself.
